## Hey! I'm Carlos Santayana Vicente, a Game Developer 👋

## About me 🧑‍💻
I am a fourth-year student in the Videogames Design and Development degree at Rey Juan Carlos University.
Along these four years I’ve learnt different aspects of the development of a videogame: game/software design, programming and art production.
Here, you will find the projects and work I've completed during my studies, as well as those I will be working on in the future.

## Videogames Repositories 🎮
- ⚔️ **[KO Cube](https://github.com/FlatWall-Games/KO-Cube)** ⚔️: KoCube is a 3vs3 competitive Hero-Shooter with Voxel Art style.
  - I was responsible for designing and implementing the abilities for one character; as well as modelling, texturing and animating two of them and a plenty of 3D props for the environments. I also created a lobby user interface for the game and managed the connection between clients.
